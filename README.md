# Platform Star Collector

This project is a non-professional ES6 implementation of the [Making Your First Phaser Game](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game) tutorial.

I used the [phaser-es6-boilerplate](https://github.com/belohlavek/phaser-es6-boilerplate) to kick start the app structure.

I've used the [Getting Started With Phaser and ES2015](http://www.thecodingcouple.com/getting-started-phaser-es2015/) as a foundation. Over time, I will continue to build on this and make it even more ES6'y.

There is quite a bit of debugging via `console.log` in the app. This is intentional as I am learning.
